## Contributions

Contributions to our documentation are welcome. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/style-guide/welcome/) and the [Contributor Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/contribute/) before making any changes.

If you would like to author an entirely new document (e.g., for a new scenario), make sure to [open an issue](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python/issues) first. This will allow the engineering team to discuss the proposed changes and ensure that it won't be overwritten by future changes.

## API Documentation

**Do not** modify any XML files in the `python/docs-ref-autogen` folder - those are generated automatically from the library source code and any changes will be automatically overwritten the next time the documentation runs.

To make changes to any API docs you will need to open a pull request in the [`AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python) repository and amend code comments.
